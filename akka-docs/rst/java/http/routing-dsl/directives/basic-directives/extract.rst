Description
-----------

The ``extract`` directive is used as a building block for :ref:`Custom Directives-java` to extract data from the
``RequestContext`` and provide it to the inner route. It is a special case for extracting one value of the more
general :ref:`-textract-java-` directive that can be used to extract more than one value.

See :ref:`ProvideDirectives-java` for an overview of similar directives.
